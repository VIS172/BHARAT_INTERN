Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-classification.git
cd titanic-classification
Create a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It contains various features about the passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

Features
The dataset includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Fare paid by the passenger
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Usage
To run the analysis and build the model, execute the following command:

sh
Copy code
python main.py
Model Training
The project includes various machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers. The models used include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines
Neural Networks
The training process involves:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)
Feature engineering and selection
Model training and hyperparameter tuning
Evaluation using cross-validation
Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Results
The final results of the models, along with their evaluation metrics, are saved and can be reviewed in the results directory. A detailed report and visualization of the results are also included in the notebooks directory.
